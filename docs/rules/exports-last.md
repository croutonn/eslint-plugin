## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind exports being sprinkled throughout a file, you may not want to enable this rule.

#### ES6 exports only

The exports-last rule is currently only working on ES6 exports. You may not want to enable this rule if you're using CommonJS exports.

If you need CommonJS support feel free to open an issue or create a PR.
